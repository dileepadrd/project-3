# Title: Supply Chain Management using Smart Contract and Blockchain

## Introduction:
In the world of business, supply chain management plays a vital role in ensuring that products are delivered efficiently and effectively to customers. However, managing a supply chain can be a challenging task, especially when it comes to ensuring transparency, security, and accountability. This is where blockchain technology and smart contracts come in. By using these technologies, we can create a more efficient and trustworthy supply chain management system.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a supply chain management system using smart contracts and blockchain technology. This system will ensure transparency, security, and accountability in the supply chain, making it more efficient and trustworthy.

## Solution:
We will develop a smart contract that will include the details of the product, such as its name, quantity, price, and delivery date. The smart contract will be created by the supplier, and the buyer will agree to the terms of the contract and sign it digitally using their private keys. Once the buyer sends the payment to the smart contract's address, the supplier will deliver the product to the logistics provider and record the transaction on the blockchain.

The logistics provider will then deliver the product to the buyer and record the transaction on the blockchain. The buyer will verify the product's quality and quantity and confirm the transaction on the blockchain. Once all the conditions of the contract are met, the smart contract will automatically release the payment to the supplier.

We will also develop a website that will allow suppliers, buyers, and logistics providers to manage the supply chain. The website will be connected to the smart contract and will display real-time data on the status of the supply chain. This will allow all parties involved in the supply chain to monitor the progress of the delivery and ensure that everything is running smoothly.

## Conclusion:
Using blockchain technology and smart contracts, we can create a more efficient and trustworthy supply chain management system. By developing a smart contract that includes the details of the product and connecting it to a website that displays real-time data on the status of the supply chain, we can ensure transparency, security, and accountability in the supply chain.
